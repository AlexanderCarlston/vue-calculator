# vue-calculator

> Task: Create a calculator app using Vue.js. The calculator should be capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation. It should be usable via mouse and keyboard. Before you start, choose three aspects that you intend to focus on (e.g. design, maintainability, etc.) and briefly explain why you chose each.

## My three focuses
* Design (Mobile friendly)
* Readability (Simplicity over complexity)
* Functionality (Use functions efficiently)

## Design Goals
The reason I picked design was I always want to take pride in what I'm making, and making things mobile friendly is always a design decision. I also love human centered design, so I always plan my projects well and think about the user experience.
* Mobile friendly
* Looks good

## Readability Goals
The reason I picked readability is there are a lot of reusability when creating a calcuator, so I want my code to be easily readable. I've come to realize simplicity is more impressive than complexity because simplicity show's you're thinking about people who might work with/on your code. 

* Readable functions
* Readable structure
* Keep the calculator to one component (This is what I would need to do when working with a team)

## Functionality Goals
The reason I picked functionality is because there are a lot of edge cases that I want to prioritize, and decide what I want this calculator to do overall. Even with a simple project there are a lot of considerations that you need to be aware of, so I want to focus on what I can/should get done functionality wise.
* Simple functionality (Add, subtract, etc)
* Support more than one operation
