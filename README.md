# vue-calculator

> Task: Create a calculator app using Vue.js. The calculator should be capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation. It should be usable via mouse and keyboard. Before you start, choose three aspects that you intend to focus on (e.g. design, maintainability, etc.) and briefly explain why you chose each.

## My three focuses
* Design (Mobile friendly)
* Readability (Simplicity over complexity)
* Functionality (Use functions efficiently)


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
